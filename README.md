Learning JS Fundamentals via Practice Problems 

## Introdcution 
This is a collection of problems that I am currently working on or have worked on during my journey to self learning the JavaScript fundamentals. These are what are considered **building blocks** to learning.  

Each person learns differently. Some are able to learn by watching videos, others are able to just pick it up from reading, some need to practice, whilst others need a combination of all of the above . I wish that I had the natural ability to pick this up, but I don't. I've found that the best way for me to really learn is to work on practice problems. With each new problem I am **unlocking** a new skill or technique. 
 
Practice problems are gathered from a number of resources including, but not limited to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/susiecee) and [HackReactor](www.hackreactor.com)'s practice problems (152 free problems). 

## Pace 
Follow my journey to learning to code. It may be a slow progression, but some progression is **always** better than *no* progression, so I'll take it!

## Self Learning Process 
If you have absolutely 0 background in CS/coding, remember to be **realistic**. I wish I was told this when I first started. Instead, when I struggled, I was told that people learn to code with no background when struggling through the first 152 problems on Repl.it and asking Hack Reactor staff about my progression & if this was correlation to my success as a developer. Yes, there are an immense number of developers with 0 background in the tech field, but what I wish I heard was,

>"It will take some time, go at your own pace and remember that you never stop learning, but the bulk of your learning will be in the beginning and this would perhaps be the hardest especially when you are self learning"  

The Udacity Introduction to JavaScript course was the  *pre-requisite* to do the Repl.it challenges. Let me tell you right now before you start hyperventilating and feeling like you are dumb. 

>First, you are **not** dumb. 

>Second, the pre-requisite, **wasn't** enough to do those problems. It wasn't even close. You can probably get past the first 20 basic problems.  Don't beat yourself over the problems if you can't do them. The beginning will be the hardest.   

>Third, remember, when I said it will take some time?  I meant it. It took me about 4 weeks (1 week being sick with the flu dying slowly in bed) to just finish the 02/05/2018 challenge probles listed. It was a long, dreadful, but informative learning experience that really puts you through the ringer. 

To be continued... I have to code right now .
