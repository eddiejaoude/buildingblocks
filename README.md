Learning JS Fundamentals via Practice Problems 

## Introdcution 
This is a collection of problems that I am currently working on or have worked on during my journey to self learning the JavaScript fundamentals. These are what are considered **building blocks** to learning.  

Each person learns differently. Some are able to learn by watching videos, others are able to just pick it up from reading, some need to practice, whilst others need a combination of all of the above . I wish that I had the natural ability to pick this up, but I don't. I've found that the best way for me to really learn is to work on practice problems. With each new problem I am **unlocking** a new skill or technique. 
 
Practice problems are gathered from a number of resources including, but not limited to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/susiecee) and [HackReactor](www.hackreactor.com)'s practice problems (152 free problems). 

## Pace 
Follow my journey to learning to code. It may be a slow progression, but some progression is **always** better than *no* progression, so I'll take it!
